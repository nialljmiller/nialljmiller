## 🚀 About Me

I'm a computational astrophysicist and machine learning researcher building tools for stellar modeling, synthetic photometry, and large-scale time-series classification. My work lives at the intersection of numerical astrophysics, AI, and high-performance computing — spanning from TESS binary evolution to deep learning representations of infrared variables.
